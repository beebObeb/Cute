# Cute 

A creative and fun way to read a source code. 

Cute.cpp 
--------

A cpp program to animate source codes. 

simple, fun and creative way to view source codes. 


How does it work?
-----------------

It works by first reading a command from the command line argument then it parses the command and returns

appropriate error message if any occurs, then reads the file and stores it in a variable if there are no error.

afterwards, it clears the terminal window and animates the source code character by character.

How to compile?
---------------
g++ cute.cpp -o cute
